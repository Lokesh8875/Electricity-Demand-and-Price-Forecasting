## About the Dataset:

The energy consumption and weather data from various cities in Spain are combined to create a multivariate time series forecasting problem. The energy dataset contains features related to the generation of energy from different sources like fossil fuels, wind, and coal. On the other hand, the weather dataset contains features related to various weather metrics such as temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, etc.

The dataset includes a four-year record of weather data <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">https://openweathermap.org/api</a> 
electrical consumption, pricing, and generation data for Spain <a href="https://transparency.entsoe.eu/dashboard/show">ENTOSE website</a> . The public ENTSOE portal was used to retrieve the consumption and generation data, while 
the Spanish TSO Red Electric Espa√±a was used to obtain the settlement prices <a href="https://www.esios.ree.es/en/market-and-prices?date=27-03-2023#">TSO website</a>. 

# Method 
The code consists of 4 main parts:

- Data loading and feature exploartion: This part uses os and pandas to load, process the data into a dataframe, plotting correlation matrix on both the dataset. 
- Preprocessing: Involves getting rid of Null values, selecting features required hour,weekday, month, year from the data and plotting visualization, followed by normalizing and reshaping the data follwed by using The Dickey-Fuller test to check if thr data us stationary
- Model building and training: This part using PCA to select the features necessary,normalizing target variables and then building forecasting models With XGBoost, GRU, LSTM, CNN, CNN-LSTM,LSTM attention, GRU-XGboost, LSTM attention-XGboost.
- We plot the train an validation Mean Absolute Error for each case and also compare the scores across the different models towards the end.

## Requirements

To run the code, you need to install the following libraries:

- matplotlib
- Numpy, panda, math
- Seaborn
- Xgboost
- Tensorflow
- keras
- Scikit Learn 

## Models used in this project : 

#### 1. Machine learning : 
 * XGboost Regressor
#### 2. Deep learning/Stacked models :
* GRU 
* LSTM 
* CNN 
* CNN-LSTM 
* LSTM-Attention 
#### 3. Hybrid methods:   
* GRU-XGBoost 
* LSTM-Attention-XGBoost 

## Results
The MAE (Mean Absolute Error) is used to report the results for the normalized test set:
* TSO prediction : 0.070
* XGboost : 0.016
* GRU : 0.015
* LSTM : 0.018
* CNN : 0.025
* CNN-LSTM : 0.019
* LSTM-Attention : 0.015
* Hybrid GRU-XGBoost : 0.014
* Hybrid LSTM-Attention-XGBoost : 0.015
Note : According to the findings, the hybrid methods demonstrated better performance in terms of MAE compared to other methods. It is worth mentioning that all machine learning/deep learning methods outperformed TSO prediction.
